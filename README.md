# Codev Backend (Hackathon Prototype)

The backend service for **Codev**, an AI-powered developer teammate designed to integrate with Discord and VS Code. This project is a work-in-progress prototype, developed as part of a hackathon to demonstrate the core functionality and potential of Codev.

---

## Overview

**Codev** envisions an AI-powered virtual teammate that collaborates seamlessly with developers in real-time. This backend prototype lays the groundwork for the system by handling basic API requests, Discord bot interactions, and integration with an AI-powered code assistant.

---

## Current Features (50% Complete)

As a hackathon project, the backend currently supports the following features:
**AI-Powered Assistance (Limited)**:
   - Processes basic code generation and debugging queries using AI.
   - Provides initial proof-of-concept for integrating AI with developer tools.

**Frontend Communication**:
   - Limited API support for synchronizing with the [Codev Frontend](https://github.com/iamnirmank/Codev-Frontend).

**Scalable Architecture**:
   - Early-stage implementation of backend services to demonstrate scalability and modular design.

---

## Pending Features

The following features are part of the original vision but remain incomplete due to time constraints during the hackathon:

- **Advanced AI Query Handling**:
  - Full-scale support for debugging, analysis, and multi-language code generation.
- **Comprehensive Discord Bot Commands**:
  - Integration of advanced collaborative tools, like task management and project updates.
- **VS Code Extension Support**:
  - Real-time integration with VS Code for debugging and code analysis.
- **User Authentication and Management**:
  - Implementation of secure login, registration, and session management.
- **Database Integration**:
  - Persistent data storage for user settings, project metadata, and bot configurations.

## Project Structure

The backend is structured to showcase the core concepts, with modular components for Discord integration, AI processing, and API services. Though incomplete, it highlights the potential for a fully-functional developer assistant.

---

## Vision and Future Plans

Despite being only 50% complete, **Codev** represents a bold step toward revolutionizing developer collaboration and productivity. Future work will focus on completing the remaining features, optimizing performance, and refining the user experience.

The ultimate goal is to create a seamless, intelligent teammate that supports developers in every aspect of their workflowâ€”from brainstorming to debugging.
